# orphan_codes
Repo of bits of code that could, but didn't get noticed. hackety hack!

1. The first one is for a module 2, project 1, extension using Ajax/JQuery.  The project was building a baby googlish analytics, as an exercise to building a CRUD program using Sinatra. 
Hackey and inelegant 2/2 to the my lack of experience coding in jax/query.  But as it is, it successfully post to events page in jumpstartlab.
